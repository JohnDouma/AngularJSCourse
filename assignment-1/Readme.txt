This is the first assignment for the Coursera course:
   "Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS"

The basic functionaiity has been provided.
    If the user provides no data before pushing the button, they will
    receive a message asking them to provide data.

    If the user enters more than three items then the user will be informed
    that they are eating too much.

    If the user enters three or fewer item, they will be told to enjoy their
    lunch.

Note that no effort was made to detemine that the entered items are not blank
nor was any attempt to determine if what was entered was actually food. for
example, the user will be told to enjoy his lunch of shoes and nails.

No styling attributes were applied to any of the html elements outside of
the ones provided by the starter project.
